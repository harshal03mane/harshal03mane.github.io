                            Falls is the invention of a roaring youth. Born in the Kushi of Ratangadda, the Pravara
                            river,
                            aftertaking a 20 km walk through the mountain range, suddenly descends into a 50 meter deep
                            valley.At that time, there was a musical atmosphere created by the combination of all that
                            rainy
                            mangakallol of water, the white smoke of the water, the majesty of the frost and the rainbow
                            rising
                            onthose frosts, the sound of the deafening silence.
                            In the rainy season, the rainbow falls even more dramatically. But at the same time, there
                            are
                            dangerous situations. In the rainy season, the waterfall at Katalpur on the other side is
                            noticeable
                            but immediately after the falls. Many Bollywood film directors also fell in love with
                            RandhaFalls.
                            There fore, the thrilling scenes of many other hit films like Maine Pyar Kiya, Prem, Kurban

                            Randha water fall In winter, water flow is less but it gave us a advantage to us saw
                            different view of Randha Waterfall. An unbelievable capacity of Pravara river. Due to less
                            water, we saw a deep downfall which some were around 200 feet. Waterfall in three steps.
                            Which sounds very nice. Riverbank is made of a full big rock. As we are on top. we saw a
                            similar height as the big rock mountain. Riverbank was distributed in two parts. One goes
                            straight and another turns left side. Because of this type scenic view point of Randha
                            waterfall has become the best tourist attraction in winter.</b>
