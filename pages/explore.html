                    <h1>Nilwande</h1>
                    <p>Nilwande Dam refers to two associated gravity dams built using roller-compacted concrete, the
                        first use in India. They are situated in Ghatghar village in Ahmednagar district Maharashtra,
                        India. Both dams create a lower and upper reservoir for the 250 MW pumped-storage hydroelectric
                        power station. The upper Nilwande dam is 15 m (49 ft) tall and on the Pravara River, a tributary
                        of Godavari river. The lower Nilwande dam is 86 m (282 ft) tall and on the Shahi Nalla River
                        directly to the south west of the upper reservoir in a steep valley. The hydro power project
                        diverts Godavari river basin water outside the basin area to a west flowing river of Western
                        ghats.

                        The power station is located between both the upper and lower reservoirs. During peak
                        electricity demand hours, water from the upper reservoir turns two 125 MW reversible Francis
                        turbine-generators. When energy demand is low, such as at night, the turbines reverse direction
                        and pump water from the lower reservoir back to the upper. Construction on the project began in
                        1995, the dams were placed beginning in 2001 and were complete by 2006. The power station was
                        commissioned in 2008.</p>
