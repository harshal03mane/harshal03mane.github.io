                    Agasti Rishi Ashram is situated on the banks of the Pravara River. As mentioned in the Ramayana, it
                    is believed that Lord Ram, Lakshman and Sita visited Sage Agastya here, where the Rishi then offered
                    Lord Ram a miraculous arrow which he later used to kill Ravan.[6]

                    Amruteshwar Temple is located at the entrance of the Ratanwadi village. It is considered to be over
                    1,200 years old and is dedicated to Lord Shiva as the main deity.[7] The temple itself has been
                    constructed in the Hemadpanthi architectural style, featuring rock carvings on the main shrine.

                    The Jagdamba Temple is situated inTahakari village. Another Hemadpanthi temple, Jagdamba features a
                    sculpture of the deity Apsaras. Similar in style to the Khajuraho temples, the main deity of
                    Jagadmba is made of wood. It is one of the most famous temples in the Ahmednagar District of
                    Maharashtra.[citation needed] The Temple is situated on the bank of river Aadhala. The festival of
                    Jagdamba Mata is organized by local people and takes place two times a year: first as the Chaitra
                    Pournima two-day Yatra festival and involves many people from nearby villages and districts who
                    travel to Darshan of Jagdamba; second as the Navratri 9-night festival of Jagdamba Mata to focus on
                    the continuous worship of Goddess Jagdamba. Detailed information about Jagdamba Temple Tahakari can
