                    <h1>Harischandra Fort</h1>
                    <p>The fort is quite ancient. Remnants of Microlithic man have been discovered here. The various
                        Puranas (ancient scriptures) like Matsyapurana, Agnipurana and Skandapurana include many
                        references about Harishchandragad. Its origin is said to have been in the 6th century, during
                        the rule of Kalachuri dynasty. The citadel was built during this era. The various caves probably
                        have been carved out in the 11th century. In these caves are idols of Lord Vishnu. Though the
                        cliffs are named Taramati and Rohidas, they are not related to Ayodhya. Great sage Changdev (one
                        who created the epic Tatvasaar), used to meditate here in the 14th century. The caves are from
                        the same period. The various constructions on the fort and those existing the surrounding region
                        point to the existence of diverse cultures here. The carvings on the temples of Nageshwar (in
                        Khireshwar village), in the Harishchandreshwar temple and in the cave of Kedareshwar indicate
                        that the fort belongs to the medieval period, since it is related to mahadeva as a totem of
                        tribes Mahadev Koli. They were controlling the fort before Moguls. Later the fort was under the
                        control of Moguls. The Marathas captured it in 1747.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever been on an adventure trip that excites you and offers a life-thrilling experience?
                        Sandhan Valley Trek is one of the most liberating and challenging tasks that you should try once
                        in a lifetime. It takes you through a marvelous journey that offers you a chance to find the
                        innermost depths of your soul and set yourself free from the fear of height.

                        .
                        The Sandhan Valley is one of the greatest canyons in the splendid setting of Sahyadri Western
                        Ghats. It attracts a large number of adventure seekers. Itâ€™s a difficult walk for everyone, but
                        once it is completed, it provides you with a sense of satisfaction. If you are a trek lover then
                        Sandhan Valley is the best place for you!

                        Sandhan Valley is located at Bhandardara near Igatpuri. Sandhan Valley is a carved valley that
                        is dark and small. Between the two high sides of a mountain range, there lies a deep narrow
                        rock-floored valley. There is no way for sunshine to enter. It is known as the shadow valley,
                        but it still looks magnificent. The water-carved valley is about 1.5 kilometres long and 200
                        feet deep. The Alang, Madan, and Kulang mountains surround the valley known as AMK- rated as the
                        toughest trek in Sahyadri.

                        Apart from trekking, there are a variety of other activities to enjoy here, like rappelling,
                        rock climbing, and, of course, camping. Lighting bonfires and spending the night under the stars
                        with your group of friends will be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Itâ€™s a difficult hike for
                        everyone, but once it is completed, it provides you with a sense of satisfaction.
